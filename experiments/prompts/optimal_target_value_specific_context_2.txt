////General Design Insights//// The compressive strength of FA/GGBFS-based geopolymer concrete improves with increased powder content due to enhanced particle packing and the pozzolanic reaction. Under ambient curing, the optimal powder content or "sweet spot" is approximately 400 kg, while under heat curing, it is closer to 420 kg/mÂ³ due to the hastened geopolymerization process. //The W/C ratio in the range of 0.45 to 0.6 results in diminished compressive strength of FA/GGBFS-based geopolymer concrete, attributed to increased porosity. A "sweet spot" W/C ratio of around 0.5 is ideal under both ambient and heat curing conditions, providing a harmonious balance between workability and strength. //A lower FA/GGBFS ratio of 0.5/0.5 in blended materials leads to increased compressive strength due to a greater GGBFS content.// Adjust the FA/GGBS ratio first, since it plays a crucial role in compressive strength due to the combined effects of FA and GGBS. Altering the W/C ratio is essential as it affects porosity and consequently, strength. Lastly, optimizing powder content is imperative as it impacts particle packing and pozzolanic reaction.
