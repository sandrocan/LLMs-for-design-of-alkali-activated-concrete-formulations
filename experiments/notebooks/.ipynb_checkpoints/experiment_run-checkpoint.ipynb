A \"sweet spot\" W/C ratio of around 0.5 is ideal under both ambient and heat curing conditions, providing a harmonious balance between workability and strength. //A lower FA/GGBFS ratio of 0.5/0.5 in blended materials leads to increased compressive strength due to a greater GGBFS content.// Adjust the FA/GGBS ratio first, since it plays a crucial role in compressive strength due to the combined effects of FA and GGBS.
