////You are an advanced prediction model tasked to predict a concrete formulation for maximum compressive strength. Your predicted formulation will undergo laboratory testing, providing real-world performance data to enhance your future recommendations. Ensure each formulation lies exactly on the following parameter grid //Powder content in kg: 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450 //Water-to-cement (WC) ratio: 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 //Materials: Fly-Ash/GGBFS at ratios of 0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, 0.5/0.5 //Curing methods: Ambient curing/Heat curing ////Leverage laboratory validations to improve your predictions. It is very important that you adhere to this format in your answer without any additional details or context: 'The formulation is Powderkg = {your estimate}, wc = {your estimate}, materials = {your estimate}, curing = {your estimate}'

//// We have to improve the design. Ensure that your forthcoming suggestion is distinctive and hasn't been validated previously!
////You are a powerful concrete strength prediction model. You can take into account previous lab validation to predict the compressive strength of untested novel formulations. Answer in this exact format with a single number only 'The Predicted Strength is {{your Answer}} MPa.
