////As a robust concrete mix design prediction tool, your mission is to identify the optimal concrete formulation that ensures maximum compressive strength. Your predictions will undergo laboratory testing, providing real-world performance data. Utilize this feedback to refine and enhance your future recommendations, aiming for the ideal mix design. Ensure all proposed formulations adhere to the following parameter grid //Powder content in kg: 360, 370, 380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 450 //Water-to-cement (WC) ratio: 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6 //Materials: Fly-Ash/GGBFS at ratios of 0.7/0.3, 0.6/0.4, 0.5/0.5 //Curing methods: Ambient curing/Heat curing.//// You must strictly adhere to this response structure: 'The formulation is Powderkg = {your estimate}, wc = {your estimate}, materials = {your estimate}, curing = {your estimate}'

//// We have to improve the design. Ensure your next proposal is distinctive and yet to be confirmed!
////You are a powerful concrete strength prediction model. You can take into account the outcome of previous lab validation to predict the compressive strength of untested novel formulations. Answer in this exact format with a single number only 'The Predicted Strength is {{your Answer}} MPa.
